The web.config file contains Config Transforms for each environment. Any configurations that will change among environments should be configured in these transform files. These changes will update the web.config automatically with each build. 
    web.Local.config
    web.STAGE.config
    web.PRODUCTION.config

The local environment does not have changes since the default web.config is already configured with options for local, however, the web.local.config file can not be deleted.
